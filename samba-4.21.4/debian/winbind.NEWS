samba (2:3.5.11~dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

    PAM modules and NSS modules have been split out from the winbind
    package into libpam-winbind.

    If Recommends: installs are disabled on your system you may need
    to manually install the libpam-winbind package after upgrading
    from former versions of winbind (for instance from squeeze)
