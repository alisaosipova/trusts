samba (2:3.6.5-2) unstable; urgency=low

    NSS modules have been split out from libpam-winbind to
    libnss-winbind.

    If Recommends: installs are disabled on your system you may need
    to manually install the libnss-winbind package after upgrading
    from former versions of winbind (for instance from squeeze) or
    from former versions of libpam-winbind.
