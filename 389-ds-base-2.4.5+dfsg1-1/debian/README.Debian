To complete the 389 Directory Server installation just run /usr/sbin/setup-ds.

If you experience problems accessing the Directory Server, check with
"netstat -tapen |grep 389" and verify that the server is not listening only
to ipv6 (check for ^tcp6). In such case you will need to tweak the cn=config
DIT with something like the following:

dn: cn=config
changetype: modify
add: nsslapd-listenhost
nsslapd-listenhost: <youripv4>
